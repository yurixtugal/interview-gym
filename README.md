# Interview Gym

LeetCode and coding interview problems solved in TypeScript with Vitest.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm test
```

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run specific test file
pnpm test hello-world

# Execute a TypeScript file directly
pnpm run tsx src/hello-world.ts
```

## Structure

- `src/arrays/` - Array problems
- `src/strings/` - String problems
- `src/linked-lists/` - Linked list problems
- `src/trees/` - Tree problems
- `src/hello-world.ts` - Example starter

## Progress

- [x] Hello World (Example)
- [x] Two Sum
- [ ] Valid Anagram
- [ ] Contains Duplicate
- [ ] Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
- [ ] Valid Parentheses
- [ ] Maximum Subarray
- [ ] Merge Two Sorted Lists
- [ ] Reverse Linked List
- [ ] Invert Binary Tree

## Problem Categories

### Arrays
- Two Sum
